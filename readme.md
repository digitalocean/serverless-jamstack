This repo contains sample code for a serverless Jamstack tutorial that teaches users how to intergrate serverless functions into their Jamstack site. The tutorial will be published soon at docs.digitalocean.com.

Once you complete the tutorial, the sample website contains:

* DigitalOcean Serverless Functions (written in node) as a replacement for traditional backend APIs. The functions retrieve content from a MongoDB and render it on a static HTML page.
* A static HTML website that uses CSS Bootstrap elements for styling and Axios to invoke the functions. The site contains a few JS scripts to dynamically render content.
